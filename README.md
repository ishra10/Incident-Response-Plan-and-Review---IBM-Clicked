# Incident-Response-Plan-and-Review---IBM-Clicked
# Overview
In this Mini Sprint, As a Cyber Security professional responsible for handling and mitigating threats,created a detailed IR report based on NIST Incident Response Process Framework . A comprehensive post-incident review has been presented to key stakeholders, ensuring they are informed, reassured, and aware of any necessary next steps.

This repository contains a Post-Incident Review Report for a simulated unusual network activity. NIST Incident Response Process Framework, detailing the steps taken to handle and mitigate the incident in a practice scenario.

This scenario was part of a learning experience designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity challenges in a healthcare setting.

# Scenario - Maven Clinic - Unusual Activity
 Maven Clinic, a file transfer platform, recently flagged some unusual network activity that has raised alarms. The senior management is taking this incident very seriously, given the medical data contained on the network. As a security analyst for Maven Clinic, your task is to identify the nature of this alert, its potential impact, suggest mitigation strategies, and compile a review. You will be working closely with Gemma Chan, CTO to complete this project.

 # Key Stages
 
 1. **Preperation :** The incident response preparation stage involves planning and preparing for potential security incidents. This includes developing an incident response plan, designating roles and responsibilities, establishing communication protocols, and conducting training exercises.
 
 2. **Event Detection and Analysis :**
    
Monitoring: Continuously monitor systems, networks, and applications for unusual activity or anomalies.

Alerting: Trigger alerts when suspicious events are detected.

Analysis:

Relate detected events to identify patterns and potential threats.
Investigate the nature and severity of the incident.
Prioritization: Determine the priority of the incident based on its potential impact.

Investigation:

Gather Evidence: Collect relevant logs, network traffic, and system information.
Analyze Data: Use tools and techniques to analyze the collected data and identify the root cause of the incident.
Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): Look for specific signs of malicious activity, such as unusual network connections, unauthorized access attempts, or data exfiltration.
  
  4. **Containment:**
     
Isolate Affected Systems: If necessary, isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
Disable Compromised Accounts: Disable compromised user accounts to limit the attacker's access.
Apply Temporary Controls: Implement temporary security measures to mitigate the threat.
   
   4.**Eradication and Recovery:**
   
Remove Malware: Identify and remove any malicious software from the affected systems.
Restore Systems: Restore affected systems and data to their pre-incident state.
Patch Vulnerabilities: Apply security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

   5.**Post-Incident Review:**
   
Document the Incident: Create a detailed report documenting the incident, its impact, and the response taken.
Identify Lessons Learned: Analyze the incident to identify areas for improvement and prevent future occurrences.
Update Incident Response Plan: Revise the incident response plan based on the lessons learned. 

## Learning Experience

This report was created as part of the **Clicked Incident Response and Review Mini Sprint (9/23/24)**, a hands-on learning experience where participants stepped into the role of cybersecurity professionals to practice managing and mitigating security incidents.

### Learning Objectives:

This project created as a part of **Clicked Incident Response and Review Mini Sprint held on Sep-oct 2024**
This offers a dynamic and collaborative learning journey, where participants engage in real-world business challenges within teams or accountability groups, guided by Clicked Coaches. This experience enables participants to produce tangible deliverables contributing to a comprehensive solution or recommendation, honing professional skills and gaining practical experience. 
The Main objective is to :
- Use **NIST Incident Response Process** to handle and mitigate simulated threats.
- Create comprehensive post-incident reports for stakeholders.
- Improve cybersecurity response strategies through lessons learned in a simulated environment.
**Scope**
  The main goals of the incident response Plan:  
  1. To minimize the damage of the attack.
  2.To minimize the time of recovery from the attack.
  3.To create instructions and defensive measures that would prevent such attacks in the future.
